# Power Automate: How to Send Emails to Excel Automatically

Microsoft has recently stopped supporting VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in the New Outlook. For many professionals and small businesses, VBA was a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks like extracting email data. Without it, processes can become manual and time-consuming. Fortunately, there's a way: Power Automate.

Power Automate is a low-code, no-code platform that allows you to create workflows to handle tasks like capturing email addresses from Outlook and saving them into an Excel spreadsheet. This solution is easy to set up and works seamlessly, making it an excellent alternative for those affected by the VBA discontinuation.

### Real-Life Scenarios for Businesses
This automation isn't just convenient; it solves real problems for industries like finance, HR, and tax consultancy:
Finance: A financial advisor regularly receives inquiries from potential clients via email. By automating the collection of email addresses, they can keep an updated list of leads in an Excel file, saving hours of manual entry.

HR: An HR manager often receives job applications through email. Automating the process of storing applicants' email addresses into Excel ensures the hiring team can easily track candidates and communicate quickly.

Tax Consultancy: A tax consultant who receives emails from clients about their documents can use Power Automate to automatically record client details in Excel for streamlined follow-up and record-keeping.


This workflow eliminates the need for manual data entry and ensures accuracy, saving time and reducing errors.

## Why Choose Power Automate?
Power Automate is user-friendly, flexible, and doesn't require coding knowledge. It's the perfect alternative for professionals impacted by the decision to phase out VBA. By adopting this tool, businesses can maintain their productivity and even enhance efficiency.
